# Sondao

Sondao allows you to create and custom family trees. Its primary purpose is to support legal operations regarding inheritance. 
Although currently the app supports only a few cases of possible tree layouts but updates are planned in the hope of covering articles provided by KC ("Kodeks Cywilny").
